function [A,Wout]=mkfilt_mne(L,C,alpha)
% [A]=mkfilt_lcmv(L,C,alpha)
%
% Input:
% L: Lead field matrix, NxMx3 matrix for N channels, M voxels and 3 dipole
%    directions
% C:  NxN matrix for N channels covariance matrix or real part of cross-spectrum
%    (The program uses only the real of C)
% 
% Output
% A  : 3-dimension filter
% 
% History
% code implemented in the same style than mkfilt_lcmv and mkfilt_eloreta by Guido Nolte
