%RUN_NETWORK_ANALYSIS	ROI correlation and partial correlation matrices
%
% [CORRELATIONMATS] = run_network_analysis(DLIST, Settings) runs a
%   correlation-based network analysis between ROIs on a set of
%   source-reconstructed data. These are provided as a cell array of SPM12
%   MEEG objects, or their filenames, in DLIST. 
%
%   Relevant input parameters are held in Settings:
%      spatialBasisSet          - the name of a binary nifti file which 
%                                 holds the voxel allocation for each ROI
%                                 (each ROI allocation is a volume), or a
%                                 spatial basis set from ICA (each spatial
%                                 map is a volume)
%
%      gridStep                 - grid step in mm of spatialBasisSet nifti
%                                 file. 
%
%      timeRange                - two-component vector of times to
%                                 sub-select a range for analysis. Leave as
%                                 empty ([]) to use the entire range
%                                 (default behaviour). Also can be passed
%                                 as a cell array of two-component vectors,

%
%      Regularize               - Structure controlling the use of
%                                 regularization to find partial
%                                 correlation matrices, using the graphical
%                                 lasso. It has fields:
%            .do            : true or false: controls use of
%                             regularization. [false]
%            .method        : 'Bayesian' or 'Friedman': use Wang (2012)'s
%                             Bayesian graphical lasso or Friedman (2007)'s
%                             graphical lasso

%                             If a vector is selected, 10-fold cross-validation
%                             is used to pick the optimal rho-parameter
%                             for each subject. The corrected Akaike
%                             Information Criterion is used to select
%                             the optimal rho. 
%                             [Friedman only]
%            .adaptivePath  : true or false: adapt path if the best
%                             regularization parameter is on the edge of
%                             the path. Then finesse the path three times. 
%                             [Friedman only] 
%            .Prior         : structure with fields controlling the shape
%                             of the gamma(x; a, 1/b) hyperprior on the 
%                             regularization parameter. 
%                             If this field is not set, the default Kerman 
%                             (2011) neutral hyperprior is used (a=1/3, b=0)
%                             [Bayesian only]

%           for references, type `help ROInets.run_correlation_analysis'. 
%
%           If the Bayesian method is selected and the nEmpiricalSamples
%           options is used (see below), each empirical sample will use a
%           different regularization parameter at random from the posterior
%           distribution of regularization parameters used as part of the
%           MCMC scheme. nEmpiricalSamples should be relatively high to
%           adequately sample the space of 8000 values. 
%
%      leakageCorrectionMethod  - choose from 'symmetric', 'pairwise' or 
%                                 'none'.
%                                 The symmetric method is recommended. It
%                                 orthogonalises the ROI time-courses in an
%                                 all-to-all symmetric fashion. 
%                                 The pairwise method extends voxel-wise
%                                 leakage correction methods to the parcel
%                                 time-courses. Correlations between pairs
%                                 of nodes are the average of correlations
%                                 found when one node is regressed from the
%                                 other, and then visa-versa.
%                                 'None' applies no spatial leakage
%                                 correction. 
%
%      nEmpiricalSamples        - convert correlations to standard normal 
%                                 z-statistics using a simulated empirical 
%                                 distribution. This controls how many 
%                                 times we simulate null data of the same 
%                                 size as the analysis dataset. 
%                                 Set to zero to make normal assumptions, 
%                                 and decrease runtime. 
%                                 For datasets with many ROIs, only a few
%                                 samples are required - O(10). 
%
%      ARmodelOrder             - We tailor the empirical data to have the 
%                                 same temporal smoothness as the MEG data.
%                                 Set an order of 0 to use normality
%                                 assumptions. 
%                                 An order of 1 should be ok, but you could
%                                 use partial autocorrelation on some of 
%                                 the voxel time-courses to check this 
%                                 assumption. (Check out the matlab function
%                                 aryule, and google for partial
%                                 autocorrelation.)

%      EnvelopeParams           - Structure controlling how time-courses
%                                 are enveloped and down-sampled. Has
%                                 fields:

%          .windowLength :        sliding window length for power envelope 
%                                 calculation. 2 s is a good value. 
%                                 See Brookes 2011, 2012 and Luckhoo 2012. 
%
%          .overlap      :        Overlap on the sliding window. Try 0.6?  
%
%          .useFilter    :        Set true or false to use a more 
%                                 sophisticated downsamping operation than 
%                                 a moving average to find the power envelope. 
%                                 The passed frequency is 1.0/envelopeWindowLength.
%                                 The window overlap parameter is then
%                                 irrelevant.

%                                 (recommended), to improve normality
%
%      frequencyBands           - cell array of frequency bands for analysis. 
%                                 Set to empty to use broadband. 
%                                 E.g. {[4 8], [8 13], []}
%                                 The bandpass filtering is performed 
%                                 before orthogonalisation. 
%
%      timecourseCreationMethod - 'PCA' or 'peakVoxel'  for binary

%                                 Sets whether an ROI time-course is

%
%                                 If a spatial basis set (e.g. from ICA) is

%                                 which uses the PCA method, and

%                                 of each spatial map. 
%
%      groupStatisticsMethod    - Choose 'mixed-effects' or 'fixed-effects'
%                                 for group-level analysis. The former
%                                 performs a t-test on the means of the

%                                 but is also less sensitive to

%                                 to produce interpretable results.
%
%      outputDirectory          - Set a directory for the results output
%
%      sessionName              - string used to construct filenames for

%
%      SaveCorrected            - Structure determining what is saved to

%
%  That's all you need for a resting-state analyis. 
%  If you want to run a task analysis on epoched data, you'll also need
