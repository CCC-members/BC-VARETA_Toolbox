function [L, ignore, ignore2, W] = symmetric_orthogonalise(A, maintainMagnitudes)
%SYMMETRIC_ORTHOGONALISE closest orthogonal matrix
% 
% L = SYMMETRIC_ORTHOGONALISE(A) returns orthonormal matrix L which
%   is closest to A, as measured by the Frobenius norm of (L-A). 
%
%   The orthogonal matrix is constructed from a singular value decomposition
%   of A. 
%
% L = SYMMETRIC_ORTHOGONALISE(A, KEEP_MAGNITUDES) returns the orthogonal
%   matrix L, whose columns have the same magnitude as the respective
%   columns of A, and which is closest to A, as measured by the Frobenius
%   norm of (L-A), if KEEP_MAGNITUDES is TRUE. 
%
%   The orthogonal matrix is constructed from a singular value decomposition
%   of A. 
%
% [L, ~, ~, W] = SYMMETRIC_ORTHOGONALISE(...) also returns a weighting matrix
%   such that L = A * W;
