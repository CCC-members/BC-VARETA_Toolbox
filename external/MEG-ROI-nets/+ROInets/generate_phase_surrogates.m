% This scrambles the phase spectrum whilst preserving the amplitude spectrum
% The surrogate data is rescaled to the same mean and standard deviation
%
% surrogate = generate_phase_surrogate(data, preserve_correlation, mean_term, std_term)
% 
% INPUTS
%    - data is the original timeseries, [nsamples x nchannels]
%    - preserve_correlation - apply the same phase offset to each channel. False by default
%	 - use_box_cox. false by default. If this is true, then boxcox1.m from OSL will be used to 
%	   transform the data. Each channel gets its own transformation. The inverse transform will 
%	   automatically be applied. Offsets are applied prior to doing the transform and inverse
%	   transform, following Adam Baker's implementation. However, the final rescaling of the mean
% 	   could lead to the surrogate containing negative values, even if the original data does not.
%	   This should be fine for checking correlations, since none of the rescalings affect the correlation
%	   except that if a subsequent analysis assumes the surrogate envelopes are positive, this may fail
% 	   unless an additional offset is applied
%
% OUTPUTS
%    - surrogate - the surrogate time series, same size as data
