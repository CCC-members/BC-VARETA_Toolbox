%UNIVARIATE_EDGE_TEST permutation test for group-level stats on networks
%
% [T, P, CORRP] = UNIVARIATE_EDGE_TEST(NETMATS, DESIGN, CONTRAST) performs
%    univariate testing for significance on each edge of a network matrix. 
%    Testing is performed using FSL's randomise, and uses 5000 permutations
%    of the group labels to perform nonparametric inference. 
%
%    Pass in NETMATS, which are symmetric network matrices with subjects in
%    the third dimension. The diagonals will be ignored. The DESIGN matrix
%    should have as many rows as subjects. The CONTRAST matrix should have
%    as many columns as the design matrix has columns. 
%
% [T, P, CORRP] = UNIVARIATE_EDGE_TEST(..., STANDARDISE) demeans and
%    variance normalises the design matrix, if TRUE. 
%
% [T, P, CORRP, COPE] = ... also returns the contrast of parameter
%   estimates from the regression. 
%
%   T provides single-edge T-stats; P the uncorrected p-Values; and CORRP the
%   FWE-corrected p-values. To use the weaker FDR correction, see
%   ROINETS.FALSE_DISCOVERY_RATE. 
%
% This code demeans over subjects at the top level, so it is not good for
% testing the whole-group mean effect.
