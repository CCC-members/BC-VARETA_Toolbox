function [A, A1, po]=mkfilt_lcmv(L,C,alpha)
% [A, A1, po]=mkfilt_lcmv(L,C,alpha)
% 
% Calculates the power over all grid points using lcmv
% This is a vector beamformer. For each voxel the dipole direction is chosen, which maximizes power.  
%
% Input:
% L: Lead field matrix, NxMx3 matrix for N channels, M voxels and 3 dipole
%    directions
% C:  NxN matrix for N channels covariance matrix or real part of cross-spectrum
%    (The program uses only the real of C)
% alpha: regularization parameter. In the algorthm C+alpha*eye(N) is
%        inverted. A reasonable value is alpha=trace(C)/(N*100)
%
% Output
% A  : 3-dimension filter
% A1 : 1-dimensional filter along direction with strongest power
% po : Mx1 vector for M voxels, po(i) is the power at the i.th voxel along
%      stronges direction
